# cace_serv_bias
cace_serv_bias.R is an R function that estimates treatment effects and standard errors for complier average causal effect (CACE) estimands using inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators developed in Schochet (Journal of Causal Inference, 2022). The methods pertain to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with service receipt bias, where (i) controls can access services related to the treatment; (ii) the treatment affects the offered services; and (iii) some in the intention-to-treat sample do not receive services (that is, noncompliance exists). The IPW estimators pertain to various complier populations defined by their potential service receipt decisions in the treatment and control conditions. The program allows for both clustered and non-clustered RCTs, and adjusts standard errors for estimation error in the IPW weights from the propensity score logit models predicting service receipt.
